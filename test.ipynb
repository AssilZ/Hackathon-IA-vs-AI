In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety .

An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal .

This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"], [\"You ca n't just go around assassinating the leaders of countries you do nt like !

The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one .

When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \\nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \\nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter.\"], [\"There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \\n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals.

HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \\n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \\nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have.\"], ['It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. \\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. \\nAdditionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. \\nIt is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination.'], ['After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. \\nOne reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \\nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. \\nSo, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing.']]\n"
