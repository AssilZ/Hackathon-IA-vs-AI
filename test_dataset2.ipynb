This is essentially the same as making a cash withdrawal.Bank fees: Some banks charge fees for maintaining an account or for using certain services. These fees may be automatically withdrawn from your account on a regular basis.Automatic payments: If you have set up automatic payments for bills or other expenses, the amount of the payment will be withdrawn from your account when it is due.Check payments: If you write a check to pay for something, the recipient may deposit the check and withdraw the funds from your account.Electronic transfers: You may also be subject to a cash withdrawal if you authorize an electronic transfer of funds from your account to another account.In summary, there are many ways that you could be subject to a cash withdrawal even if you do not use an ATM.
