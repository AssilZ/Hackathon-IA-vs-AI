There are several ways that this could happen:Debit card transactions: If you make a purchase using your debit card, the merchant may automatically withdraw the amount of the purchase from your checking account. This is essentially the same as making a cash withdrawal.Bank fees: Some banks charge fees for maintaining an account or for using certain services. These fees may be automatically withdrawn from your account on a regular basis.Automatic payments: If you have set up automatic payments for bills or other expenses, the amount of the payment will be withdrawn from your account when it is due.Check payments: If you write a check to pay for something, the recipient may deposit the check and withdraw the funds from your account.Electronic transfers: You may also be subject to a cash withdrawal if you authorize an electronic transfer of funds from your account to another account.In summary, there are many ways that you could be subject to a cash withdrawal even if you do not use an ATM. It is important to carefully track your account balance and be aware of any automatic transactions or payments that may be taking place.\"\n",
